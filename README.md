### Project Description (from BlackBoard)

The objective of the simulation lab is to give you hands-on experience with the planning, execution and interpretation of discrete event simulation. 

The lab consists of two parts: an **exercise part** and an **assignment part**.

 - The **exercise part** is meant as training and preparation for the assignment. You will receive three simulation tasks including solutions and you will also receive help from the course staff with understanding and solving the exercises during the special tuition hours.
 - The **assignment part** will be graded. The course staff will only give comments about possible ambiguities in the task formulations but will not help solving the tasks.

We strongly advise students to spend enough time on the exercise part and use the opportunity to thoroughly understand the concept of discrete event simulation.
